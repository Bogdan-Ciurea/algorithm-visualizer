# Algorithm visualizer

This is a personal project that is intended to display some of the algorithms that I have leaned over time but also my skills in designing software.
For this project I have decided to use the following technologies:

1.  **C++** as the go to programming language
2.  [**Raylib 4.0.0**](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/tree/4.0.0) as the graphics library + [**RayGui 3.1**](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui/tree/3.1)
3.  **CMake** to compile everything
4.  **Visual Studio Code** as the code editor
5.  **Clang-Format** in order to properly format the code
6.  **Github Actions** for the pipelines
7.  [**StackEdit**](https://stackedit.io/) for creating the `.md` files
8.  [**Draw.io**](https://www.draw.io/) for creating the diagrams

This is, at the time of developing the code, my biggest project. 😁

For more details that also cover code, please read the the [Design Document](DesignDocument.md).

Keep in mind that the project has two versions.
The first one contains a visualizer of some of the most important sorting algorithms and did not have all the features of a fully fleshed program.
The second one contains more algorithms that the first one and will incorporate algorithms from 4 fields.
|Sorting | Search | GraphInterface |
|--|--|--|--|
| Insertion Sort | Linear Search | Dijkstra's algorithm |
| Heap Sort | Binary Search | BFS & DFS |
| Selection Sort | Jump Search | A\* |
| Merge Sort | Interpolation Search | Kruskal’s algorithm |
| Quick Sort | | Topological sorting |
| Bubble Sort | | |

## How to Install and Run the Project

In order to run the project you will use the next commands in the repo's route, after downloading the files:
`mkdir build && cd build`
`cmake .. && make`
`./visualiser`

CMake will automatically download Raylib from GitHub when building the project.

## How to Use the Project

After running the compiler and launching project (as mentioned above) you should be ready to visualize the algorithms.
The project has a main interface, from where you will be able to select from 4 different options:
`Sorting Algorithms`, `Search Algorithms`, and `GraphInterface Algorithms`.

### Sorting Algorithms

As presented above, the `Sorting Algorithms` page will contain 6 different algorithms.
This page will have the following features:

- a `randomize button`, that will randomize the array;
- an `add button`, that will add one pillar to the array. Note the maximum number of pillars is 100;
- a `subtract button`, that will remove one pillar from the array. Note that the minimum number of pillars is 20;
- a `start/stop button`;
- a `back button`, that will take you back to the main menu;
- a `drop-down menu`, from which you can select the desired algorithm;
- the main drawing canvas (under the header), in which all the pillars will be animated

### Search Algorithms

As presented above, the `Search Algorithms` page will contain 5 different algorithms. This page will have the same functionality and buttons to the one containing the `Sorting Algorithms`. This page will also contain another button that will sort everything, in order to provide an example of what happens when the array is not sorted.

### Sorting Algorithms

As presented above, the `GraphInterface Algorithms` page will contain 7 different algorithms. There will also be a starting graph that should be enough for starting to play with the algorithms.
This page will have the following features:

- an `add node` mode, that will allow you do add a node on the canvas (the value of the node will be selected in a special place in the header);
- an `add edge` mode, that will allow the use to select a starting and a ending node for the edge. In order to select the _weight_ you will have to type this in the header. In order to select if the edge is _directed_ or _undirected_, you will also need to select a toggle option in the header;
- a `remove` mode, that will allow the user to remove any edges or nodes. Note that if you delete a node, all edges that come out of or point to that node will also be deleted;
- a `clear` button that will clear the canvas;
- a `select` mode, that will allow the user to select a starting and a finishing node;
- a `start/stop button` that will select two random nodes (if no nodes are selected as starting or ending) and animate the distance between them;
- a `back button`, that will take the user back to the main menu;
- a `drop-down menu`, from which you can select the desired algorithm;
- the main drawing canvas (under the header), in which everything will be animated

Keep in mind that, even if some algorithms don't work with some graphs (i.e.: Dijkstra with a graph that has a negative weight edge), my implementation will allow such cases to exist in order to better understand the error. A warning will appear wo that the user is informed about this fact.

## Structure of code

The repo folder will contain some important files:

- `src` folder -> containing the C++ files
- `include` folder -> containing all the header files
- `libs` folder -> containing the Raylib 4.0.0 library
- `assets` -> any assets additional that the project will need
- `CMakeLists.txt` -> the CMake file that will compile the project
- `assets/diagram.png` -> a diagram of the structure of the project
- `assets/DesignDocument.md` -> a design document that will go into more detain over everything
